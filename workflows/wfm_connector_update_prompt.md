# WFM Connector Update: Add Job Task Endpoints

## Problem
The WorkflowMax MCP connector currently only supports **global task endpoints** (`v2/tasks`), which manage account-level task templates. It does NOT support **job task endpoints** (`v2/jobs/tasks`), which manage tasks assigned to specific jobs — including setting estimated hours and assigning staff to job tasks.

This means we cannot:
- List the tasks within a specific job
- Update a job task's estimated hours or assigned staff
- Add new tasks to a job

## What Needs to Change

The WFM API has a completely separate set of endpoints for job-level tasks. These need to be added to the connector alongside the existing global task tools.

### 1. Add `get_job` includes support

The existing `get_job` tool calls `GET v2/jobs/{UUID}` but doesn't pass the `includes` query parameter. The API supports:

```
GET v2/jobs/{UUID}?includes=tasks,costs,notes,documents,staff,phases
```

Add an optional `includes` parameter (string or array) to the `get_job` tool so it can return tasks inline with the job. At minimum, support `includes=tasks`.

### 2. Add `list_job_tasks` tool

```
GET v2/jobs/tasks?job={jobUUID}&page={page}&pageSize={pageSize}
```

This lists all tasks assigned to a specific job. Each job task has its own UUID (different from the global task template UUID) and includes properties like estimated minutes, assigned staff, and label.

**Parameters:**
- `job` (string, required) — The UUID of the job
- `page` (number, optional) — Page number for pagination
- `pageSize` (number, optional) — Results per page

### 3. Add `update_job_task` tool

```
PUT v2/jobs/tasks/{jobTaskUUID}
```

This updates an existing task within a job. This is the critical endpoint — it sets estimated hours and assigns staff to a job task.

**URL parameter:**
- `jobTaskUUID` (string, required) — The UUID of the job task (NOT the global task UUID)

**Body parameters (all optional, send only what you want to change):**
- `estimatedMinutes` (number) — Estimated time in minutes
- `assignedStaffId` (string) — UUID of the staff member to assign
- Any other fields the API supports (check the API explorer for the full schema)

**Important:** This endpoint uses `v2/jobs/tasks/{UUID}`, NOT `v2/tasks/{UUID}`. The existing `update_task` tool calls the wrong path for job-level updates.

### 4. Add `create_job_task` tool

```
POST v2/jobs/{identifier}/tasks
```

This adds a task to a job.

**URL parameter:**
- `identifier` (string, required) — The job UUID or job number

**Body parameters:**
- `taskUUID` (string, required) — The UUID of the global task template to add (e.g. the "Digital Marketing" template UUID)
- `estimatedMinutes` (number, optional) — Estimated time in minutes
- `assignedStaffId` (string, optional) — UUID of the staff member to assign
- `label` (string, optional) — Label for the task variant (e.g. "Account Manager", "SEO Specialist")
- Other fields as supported by the API

### 5. Add `delete_job_task` tool (optional)

```
DELETE v2/jobs/tasks/{jobTaskUUID}
```

Removes a task from a job.

## How the Existing Tools Map

| Current Tool | API Path | Scope | Keep? |
|-------------|----------|-------|-------|
| `list_tasks` | `GET v2/tasks` | Global templates | Yes |
| `get_task` | `GET v2/tasks/{UUID}` | Global templates | Yes |
| `create_task` | `POST v2/tasks` | Global templates | Yes |
| `update_task` | `PUT v2/tasks/{UUID}` | Global templates | Yes |
| `delete_task` | `DELETE v2/tasks/{UUID}` | Global templates | Yes |

| New Tool | API Path | Scope |
|----------|----------|-------|
| `list_job_tasks` | `GET v2/jobs/tasks` | Tasks within a job |
| `update_job_task` | `PUT v2/jobs/tasks/{UUID}` | Update job task |
| `create_job_task` | `POST v2/jobs/{id}/tasks` | Add task to job |
| `delete_job_task` | `DELETE v2/jobs/tasks/{UUID}` | Remove from job |

### 6. Fix `create_job` tool

The existing `create_job` tool has two issues:

**a) Field name mapping bug:** The tool sends `name` and `client_id` but the WFM API expects `jobname` and `clientuuid`. The connector needs to map these correctly.

**b) Missing required fields:** The API requires `priority` (string, e.g. "Normal") and `statusuuid` (string, the job status UUID). These are not exposed as parameters. Either:
- Add them as optional parameters with sensible defaults ("Normal" and the "In Progress" status UUID `9bef861f-0d89-4151-88ff-99fc9767277d`)
- Or add a `template_id` lookup so templates can provide defaults

**c) Template support:** The tool accepts `template_id` but there's no `list_templates` endpoint to discover available templates. Add a `list_job_templates` tool if the API supports it (`GET v2/jobs/templates` or similar).

Without these fixes, jobs cannot be created via the API — they must be created manually in WFM.

### 7. Fix `update_job` tool

The existing `update_job` tool has the same field name mapping bug as `create_job`. Tested with updating `name` and `status` — neither value was applied. The API accepted the request (no error) but returned unchanged data, suggesting the connector is not mapping the parameter names to the WFM API's expected field names (e.g. `name` → `jobname`, `status` → `statusuuid`).

## Testing

After adding the endpoints, test with this known job:

**Amped Digital — Digital Marketing Retainer March 2026**
- Job UUID: `a1308747-aa51-4cd6-9aaf-4cfd87108b6c`
- Job Number: `J012821`

1. Call `list_job_tasks` with `job=a1308747-aa51-4cd6-9aaf-4cfd87108b6c` — should return 5 tasks (Account Manager, SEO Specialist, Google Ads Specialist, Paid Media Specialist, Social Media Specialist)
2. Take one of the returned job task UUIDs and call `update_job_task` with `estimatedMinutes: 780` — should update the estimated time to 13 hours
3. Call `get_job` with `includes=tasks` — should return the job with tasks included in the response
